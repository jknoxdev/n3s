**** customers, companies and client
 - here, I've seperated out each category for future
   integration with an ordering and invoicing system
   which will be split. 
     customers -> order
     clients -> invoiced
     people -> order or invoice
     customers, clients and people -> companies
     companies != invoice
     companies != order
**** serials, manufacturer, device & installations
 - a device has, a serial, a manufacturer, as well as an installation date and time
 - device lifecycle is tracked:
     installation -> deployment
     deployment -> company
